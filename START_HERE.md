# Start here

This folder is your repository. Push it to your own GitHub repository as it is, and build your system inside `code/`.

## Rules

- Change files only inside `code/`. Everything outside it is read-only.
- Run everything from `code/` with `python -m app`. A stub is in `code/app/__main__.py`.
- Read model keys and addresses only from the four variables in `code/.env.example`. Don't hard-code a key or a provider address.
- Pin every package in `code/requirements.txt` to an exact version (`name==version`). Use Python 3.12.
- Put your own test cases in `code/tests/cases/` and their expected answers in `code/tests/expected/`, in the same format as `samples/` and `samples/expected/`. `python -m app eval --cases tests/cases` writes your score to `code/tests/score.json`.
- Never commit `.env` or any key.

## Getting started

```
cd code
cp .env.example .env          # then add your keys to .env
python -m app run --case ../samples/UC4-S01.json --out out/UC4-S01.json
python -m app eval --cases ../samples
```
